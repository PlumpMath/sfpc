title: Shaders and Parsing
--- 

## Code from October 21
The code from class is all [available in a gist](https://gist.github.com/nasser/a88646874c8787ec1427)!

## Getting Shady
Make some shaders on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com). Write them from scratch, or hack existing code. Keep in mind how this kind of coding is different from other code you've written or are writing. How is it the same? A great place to get inspiration is the [#short tag](https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=tag%3Dshort). Some shaders act on one or more input images, which you may or may not consider cheating.

## Parsing
Complete the [Jisp â€“ JavaScript Lisp]({{ site.url }}/languages/jisp.html) grammar. It is the beginnings of a basic Lisp that can call JavaScript functions.
