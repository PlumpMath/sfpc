[Slides]({{ site.url }}/slides/history) and [white board]({{ site.url }}/boards/history) from our September 30 class on programming language history.

For next week, make a game in [PuzzleScript](http://www.puzzlescript.net/)! Be mindful of how the language looks, how it feels to program in it, how it compares to things you have seen before, and how its different.
