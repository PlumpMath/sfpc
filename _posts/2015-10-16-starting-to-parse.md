## JavaScript Pratice

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a nice online book that includes interactive coding examples! Part 1 is the relevant part to this class, and chapters [3](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html), [4](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html), [5](http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html), [6](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html) are the most important. Try and get through that to get a feel for the language. 

This week's language is a bit different, because we will be using JavaScript in practice for the rest of the semester. So, remain mindful of all the abstract and conceptual issues we've been talking about, but also begin preparing yourself to use this tool practically!

## Parsing

### Numbers

The number parser we wrote in class [is online]({{ site.baseurl }}/languages/numbers.html) along with [the code]({{ site.baseurl }}/languages/numbers.txt) for your study.

### Homework

The homework is designed to be lengthy and thorough. It is written to allow you to return to it after SFPC to reflect on or try again. You're not expected to master everything from the first try. This is deep magic, and it takes practice. In this and all future assignments, *try and get as far as you can in the week*, and be prepared to revisit the assignment later in the semester and further down the line in your practice. The problems are in order of complexity and build on each other, so approach them with that in mind.

That said, finish the [Lisp Calculator]({{ site.baseurl }}/languages/lisp-calculator.html) we looked at in class.

To do the homework, download the HTML file linked above into your pltjs folder, and begin editing it there. Remember to refresh the page often, or uncomment the `// PLT.refresh = true` line to enable auto-refresh.
